DELAYED ORDER POLICY

How we handle delayed orders:

1. An order is considered delayed if it has not been delivered by the expected delivery date.
2. For delayed orders, customers are entitled to:
   - Full refund if order is more than 7 days past expected delivery date
   - Partial refund or store credit if order is 3-7 days delayed
   - Shipping fee refund if order is 1-3 days delayed

3. Customers can request cancellation for delayed orders at any time.
4. We will proactively reach out to customers if orders are delayed by more than 3 days.
5. Delayed orders that are eventually delivered may still be eligible for compensation.

Detection criteria:
- Order status is PLACED or SHIPPED
- Current date is past expected_delivery_date
- Order has not been cancelled

Action recommendations:
- Orders delayed by 7+ days: Recommend cancellation with full refund
- Orders delayed by 3-7 days: Offer cancellation or partial refund
- Orders delayed by 1-3 days: Apologize and provide tracking update
